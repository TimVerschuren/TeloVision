# TeloVision

TeloVision is a python package which determines the presence of telomeres in genome assembly scaffolds. Subsequently the scaffolds are visualised along with their GC content. Telomeres will be visualised as black boxes at the ends of telomeres, while the absence of telomeres will be indicated by a white box at the en of telomeres.
